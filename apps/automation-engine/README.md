# NEXUS OS AI Automation Engine

Central nervous system that connects all NEXUS OS modules through event-driven workflows.

## Automation Stack
- **n8n** - Sole workflow automation, AI agent, and RAG engine (self-hosted, Docker)
- **WAHA** - Self-hosted WhatsApp HTTP API (QR-based), feeds n8n via webhook
- **Webhooks** - Real-time event processing

> Zapier and Make.com have been fully removed — n8n is the only automation engine, with no secondary/backup automation platform.

## Deployed Workflows

### 1. Lead to CRM Pipeline (`lead_to_crm_pipeline.json`)
```
Website Form / WhatsApp / Phone
        ↓
   Webhook Intake
        ↓
  Sales Agent (Lead Scoring)
        ↓
   HOT Lead? ──── YES ──→ CRM + WhatsApp + Slack Alert
        │
        NO ──→ CRM + Welcome Email
```
**Business Impact:** Reduces lead response time from 2 hours to < 5 minutes.

### 2. Daily Competitor Intelligence (`daily_competitor_intel.json`)

        ↓
   Scrape Competitors
        ↓
  Marketing Agent (Price Analysis)
