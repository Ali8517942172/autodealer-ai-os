# NEXUS OS

**NEXUS OS** is a production AI operating system for automotive dealerships that unifies CRM, Marketing, Knowledge Management, Sales Intelligence, Inventory Lifecycle, and Business Automation into a single platform.

The platform is designed to increase dealership profitability, reduce operational overhead, improve lead conversion, and enable AI-assisted decision making across every department. This is a live, production system built for a real paying dealership client.

## Platform Modules

### 1. AI-Powered CRM
**Business Problem:** Leads from multiple channels (website, WhatsApp, walk-ins, referrals) are handled inconsistently. Response times vary from minutes to days. No standardized qualification process.

**Solution:** AI-first CRM that automatically scores every lead, assigns priority, routes to the right salesperson, and triggers multi-channel follow-up — all within 60 seconds of lead creation.

### 2. Marketing Intelligence OS
**Business Problem:** Marketing team has no visibility into competitor pricing. Campaigns are created based on intuition rather than data. No way to measure true ROI per channel.

**Solution:** Daily automated competitor scraping with AI-powered pricing recommendations. Campaign generator that creates multi-channel content (Google, Meta, WhatsApp) based on actual market gaps. Revenue attribution that connects marketing spend directly to closed deals.

### 3. Enterprise Knowledge Assistant
**Business Problem:** Company policies, vehicle manuals, warranty terms, and sales procedures are buried in PDF folders. Employees waste hours searching for answers. New hires take weeks to become productive.

**Solution:** Multi-agent RAG system where specialized AI agents (Compliance, Sales Support, Marketing) answer questions with exact source citations. Supports HR policies, finance procedures, warranty terms, sales SOPs, and vehicle documentation.

### 4. Vehicle Inventory Intelligence
**Business Problem:** Vehicles sit in stock for months without price reviews. Holding costs (AED 50/day) silently erode margins. No systematic way to track the full vehicle lifecycle from purchase to resale.

**Solution:** AI-powered inventory lifecycle management that tracks every vehicle from import through sale, calculates real-time holding costs, flags aging stock, predicts demand, and recommends optimal pricing.

### 5. Automation Engine (`apps/automation-engine/`)
**Business Problem:** Business processes require manual handoffs between CRM, ERP, WhatsApp, email, and spreadsheets. Data gets lost. Steps get skipped. No audit trail.


### 6. Executive Dashboard (`apps/executive-dashboard/`)
**Business Problem:** Management relies on end-of-month reports to make decisions. No real-time visibility into sales pipeline, inventory health, marketing ROI, or team performance.

**Solution:** Live dashboard pulling from all modules showing today's sales, lead conversion, revenue, profit, marketing ROI, inventory aging, and AI-generated forecasts.

## Multi-Agent Architecture

Each agent is specialized for a specific business domain:

| Agent | Role | Trigger |
|-------|------|---------|
| Lead Agent | Scores and qualifies incoming leads | New lead event |
| Sales Agent | Assists salesperson with quotes, follow-ups | Salesperson request |
| Finance Agent | Checks loan eligibility, calculates EMI | Finance application |
| Inventory Agent | Monitors stock aging, recommends pricing | Daily cron / manual |
| Marketing Agent | Generates campaigns, analyzes competitors | Campaign request / daily |
| Knowledge Agent | Answers policy/manual questions with citations | Employee query |
| Compliance Agent | Validates warranty claims, checks regulations | Claim submission |
| Manager Agent | Summarizes team performance, flags issues | Daily digest |

---

## Event-Driven Architecture

The platform runs on business events, not just API calls:

```
Lead Created → Event Bus → CRM + Marketing + Notification + Analytics
Deal Closed  → Event Bus → ERP + Commission + Inventory + Dashboard
Vehicle Aged → Event Bus → Price Review + Marketing + Manager Alert
Claim Filed  → Event Bus → RAG + Service + Compliance + Customer Update
```

## Production Engineering

| Category | Implementation |
|----------|---------------|
| Authentication | Supabase Auth with JWT |
| Authorization | Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) |
| Database | Supabase (Postgres + Auth + pgvector + Storage + Realtime) |
| API Documentation | OpenAPI / Swagger |
| Containerization | Docker + Docker Compose |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions |
| Audit Trail | Every data mutation logged with user, timestamp, and diff |
| Health Checks | `/api/health` on every service |
| Rate Limiting | Per-user API rate limits |
| Secrets Management | Environment variables via `.env` (never committed) |
| Error Handling | Structured error responses with correlation IDs |
| Background Jobs | Cron-based scrapers, scheduled reports |
| API Versioning | `/api/v1/` prefix on all endpoints |

---

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Frontend | ReactJS, Vite, Tailwind CSS |
| Backend | Node.js (Express) |
| Database | Supabase (Postgres + Auth + pgvector) — single source of truth |
| AI/LLM | OpenRouter, LangChain, LangGraph |
| Automation | n8n, WAHA (WhatsApp Agent) |
| ERP | Odoo (integration layer) |

---

## Deployment Phase (Current → Target)

| Phase | Where It Runs |
|-------|---------------|
| **Now (Build Phase)** | n8n and WAHA run locally via Docker Compose. Supabase (Postgres + Auth + pgvector) is already the live cloud database — it is never local. |
| **Target (Go-Live Phase)** | Once the OS is production-ready: n8n and WAHA move to **Render**. The React frontend deploys to **Vercel**. **Supabase stays the single backend/database/auth layer throughout** — nothing changes there between phases. |

## Multi-Tenant Architecture

The platform is designed as a SaaS product adaptable to any dealership:

```
/customers
  ├── Nexus-cars/
  ├── toyota-dubai/
  ├── nissan-uae/
  └── bmw-abudhabi/
```

Each tenant gets isolated data, configurable workflows, and customizable branding.
